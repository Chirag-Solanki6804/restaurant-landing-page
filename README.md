## 📌 My process

- I joined a **Full Stack web development** course by **PWSKILLS**.<a href="https://pwskills.com/"> **Check🚀 (Not Sponsered)**</a>
- It took me about **2 hours** to complete this project.
- As I have done my previous 4 assignments but it took me more time than previous as I have to research about `transform: rotate(180deg);` property.

## 📌 What I Learn

👉 Learn about `transform: rotate(180deg);` property.  
👉 Learn about `overflow` property of CSS.  
👉 How to place images in proper places using positions.  
👉 Achieve some responsiveness using FlexBox.
